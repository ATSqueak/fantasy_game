Drobee was a formidable foe and yet you managed to defeat him. You ae weary and need to rest you see a small hillock nearby and lay down to sleep.
When you awaken it is dark, but you see a distant glow ahead. What was making the light you venture forward and see an enormous shadow moving wildly ahead.
What could that be? Past the glow and the shadow you see a twinkling and know that you have found what you were seeking. That is the definite sign of a
portal - a way back home!
However, to reach it you must confront the shadow beast ahead of you and its movements suggest a very powerful creature.
With some trepidation you slowly creep forward and the glow begins to grow brighter, and you slowly realise that the glowing light is being created by the
shadowy beast. As you near it your heart leaps into your mouth this was a dragon!!
You have reached the final stage and need to defeat the dragon Clossal if you are to make it back home.
You realise that you will need both of your fighting and magic skills to defeat him.
