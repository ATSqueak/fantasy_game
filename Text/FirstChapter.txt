You enter a forest. It is dark and gloomy and the ground thick with fallen leaves and over-growing moss.
You find it hard to make your way through but you see a clearing ahead and struggle to make your way towards it.
In this small circle of light there are no trees and the sun can shine through it is bare patch of ground and
standing before you is a menacing character. This is "Lesser" and it seems you must fight him to be able to pass.
