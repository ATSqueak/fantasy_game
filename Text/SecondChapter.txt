You are weary after your battle with Lesser.
You slow make your way past the clearing and through the forest which grows less dense with each step you take.
Finally, you come to the edge of the forest and see a vast plain ahead of you.
You will need to replenish your water supplies before traversing it.
You head back into the forest and suddenly notice a whip of a branch as something brushes pass you and immediately you are aware that your water bottle is gone.
Stolen! It was certainly there just before.
You see a shadowy figure flitting through the trees away, and you give chase.
You manage to catch up with the lean sinewy figure this is Sneak and to retrieve your water bottle you must fight as he does not look
like he will relinquish it freely.
