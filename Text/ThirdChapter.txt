You ae thirsty after your fight with Sneak. You retrieve your water bottle and quickly fill it at a nearby stream of water.
You are ready to tackle the plain at the edge of the forest.
It takes a while, but you make progress however you notice that the way ahead is not clear and shimmers slightly.
You put this down to the overpowering sun overhead causing a visual aberration, but there is something else...
As you walk onwards the shimmer starts to coalesce and form a figure. A tall menacing figure rises before you electric bolts crackling from its fingers.
This is Drobee a magician and to pass you must magic to defeat him.
